JocStrap provides bindings for the iPhone ObjectiveC-Frameworks.

The C-Frameworks are not accesible though. StrapTease closes this gap by providing bindings to those APIs.

Currently supported:
CoreGraphics, OpenGLES, OpenAL

To build this library you need the [maven-pkg-plugin](http://wiki.evolvis.org/mvn-pkg-plugin/index.php/Main_Page).
